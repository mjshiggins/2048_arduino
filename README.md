2048_arduino
============

The popular game 2048 on the Gameduino 2 platform. Use the four zones of the touchscreen
to move the game pieces (up, down, left, right). There is a gameboard image that can be used
with a compass rose in the corner, but the code is not currently setup with the adjusted
touch-screen zones. That, however, would be trivial to change.

Does not require the use of the gameboard image,
but it looks a lot better. Someone with some real photoshop skills could brush it up. I used some
motion blurring to make it feel a bit more old school, like a CRT.
